  <h1 class = "project_header">BrainPicker</h1>
  <h1 class = "project_description">"Practice mapping the brain's parts and functions to their physical location in this gamified learning experience! Compete to be on the Top 10 Leaderboard or just to beat your own personal best! Remeber: Try your best to spread the each point! The more spread, the higher your score!" </h1>
  <h1 class = "project_description">This project was made during my time at the Teaching Learning Lab for the Neuroscience students at Stony Brook University. It was developed using a JS/JQuery front end and a PHP backend. In Fall of 2018, the first version of BrainPicker was released and has been played by a total 68 Stony Brook Neuroscience students. The project was well received by students, and, after I developed an automatic grading script, was even used as an extra credit assignment!  </h1>

  <h1 class = "src_code"> Note: In order to play the live game, you must have a Stony Brook University NetID and password. Also, the source code makes calls to Stony Brook specfic PHP functions, so you cannot download a full working version. If desired, I will gladly show off the project at an interview.</h1>
